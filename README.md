Task Summaries

Task 1 – Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

Objective: Understand and visualize the Iris dataset.
Key Steps:
Loaded dataset using Pandas.
Explored dataset structure with .shape, .columns, and .head().
Visualized relationships between features using scatter plots, histograms, and boxplots.
Skills Developed: Data inspection, basic summarization, visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

Task 2 – Credit Risk Prediction

Objective: Predict whether a loan applicant will default.
Key Steps:
Handled missing values and cleaned the dataset.
Visualized distributions of key features such as loan amount, income, and education.
Trained Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.
Skills Developed: Data cleaning, EDA, binary classification, model evaluation.

Task 3 – Customer Churn Prediction

Objective: Identify customers likely to leave the bank.
Key Steps:
Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset.
Encoded categorical variables like gender and geography.
Built a classification model to predict churn.
Analyzed feature importance to identify key factors affecting churn.
Skills Developed: Categorical encoding, supervised classification, feature importance analysis.

Task 4 – Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts

Objective: Estimate medical insurance charges.
Key Steps:
Trained a Linear Regression model.
Visualized impact of BMI, age, and smoking status on charges.
Evaluated model performance using MAE and RMSE.
Skills Developed: Regression modeling, feature correlation, error evaluation.

Task 5 – Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction

Objective: Predict which customers will accept a personal loan offer.
Key Steps:
Explored features such as age, job, and marital status.
Trained Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers.
Extracted insights about customer groups more likely to accept offers.
Skills Developed: Data exploration, classification modeling, business insight extraction.
